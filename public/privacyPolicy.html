        <p class="last-updated">
          <strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 26, 2025
        </p>

        <h2>1. Introduction and Scope</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy details the commitment of CodeManipulate ("we,"
          "us," or "our") to safeguarding the privacy of individuals ("you,"
          "your," "user") who access, browse, or use our website and its
          associated services, including but not limited to code formatting,
          minification, and translation tools (collectively, the "Services").
          This document outlines our principles and practices regarding the
          collection, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of your data,
          including Personal Data and other information.
        </p>
        <p>
          By engaging with our Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
          comprehended, and consented to the data practices described in this
          Privacy Policy and our accompanying Terms of Service. If you do not
          agree with any part of this policy, you must refrain from using our
          Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Definitions:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Personal Data:</strong> Any information relating to an
              identified or identifiable natural person.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Usage Data:</strong> Data collected automatically, generated
              either by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure
              itself (for example, the duration of a page visit).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Processing:</strong> Any operation or set of operations
              which is performed on Personal Data or on sets of Personal Data.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect and Process</h2>
        <p>
          To provide and enhance our Services, we collect several types of
          information from and about our users. The collection is limited to what
          is necessary for the legitimate purposes outlined in this policy.
        </p>

        <h3>2.1. Data Provided Directly by You</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Content:</strong> This refers to the code, text, queries,
            or other data snippets that you voluntarily input into our tools for
            processing ("User Content"). Our core privacy principle is that
            <strong>we do not permanently store or log the substantive content
            of your User Content.</strong> Processing is performed in-memory or
            via transient, stateless API calls. Once the Service has performed
            the requested manipulation and delivered the output, the input User
            Content is programmatically discarded. We do not use your User
            Content for any purpose other than fulfilling your direct request.
            You are strongly cautioned against entering any sensitive data, trade
            secrets, credentials, or protected health information into our
            tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Correspondence Data:</strong> If you contact us via email or
            other means for support or feedback, we will process your name, email
            address, and the content of your communication. This data is used
_           exclusively to address your inquiry and is retained only as long as
            necessary to resolve the matter.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Data Collected Automatically (Usage Data)</h3>
        <p>
          As you navigate and interact with our Services, we employ automated
          data collection technologies to gather certain information about your
          equipment, browsing actions, and patterns.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Server Log Information:</strong> Our servers automatically
            record information that your browser sends whenever you visit our
            website. These server logs may include information such as your web
            request, Internet Protocol (IP) address (which may be used to infer
            your general geographic location), browser type and language, device
            type, operating system, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of
            clicks, and the date and time of your request. This data is essential
            for security monitoring, error diagnosis, and analyzing service
            performance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Usage Metadata:</strong> We collect anonymized or
            aggregated metadata about your interactions with the Services. This
            includes which tools are used, the language of the code processed
            (e.g., "JavaScript", "Python"), the size of the input data (in
            bytes), and the success or failure of the operation. This metadata does
            not contain any part of your User Content but is vital for us to
            understand service popularity, identify performance bottlenecks, and
            guide future development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies and
            similar tracking technologies to track activity on our Service and
            hold certain information. For a detailed explanation, please see
            Section 6, "Cookie Policy and User Choices."
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for
          collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy
          Policy depends on the Personal Data we collect and the specific context
          in which we collect it. We will normally process your Personal Data only
          where:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>It is necessary for the performance of a contract:</strong> To
            provide the core functionality of our Services to you. Your use of our
            tools constitutes a request, and our processing of your data to
            fulfill that request is a contractual necessity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>It is in our legitimate interests:</strong> We process data for
            our legitimate interests, provided that these interests are not
            overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights
            and freedoms. Our legitimate interests include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ensuring the security and integrity of our Services.
              </li>
              <li>
                Analyzing usage patterns to improve and optimize our Services.
              </li>
              <li>
                Debugging and fixing technical issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                Defending against legal claims and enforcing our terms.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You have given us consent to do so:</strong> For example, for
            the use of certain non-essential cookies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To comply with a legal obligation:</strong> We may need to
            process your data to comply with legal or regulatory requirements.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Purpose and Use of Information</h2>
        <p>
          We use the information we collect for the following business and
          operational purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service Provision and Operation:</strong> To deliver the core
            functionality of our tools, process your requests, and maintain the
            day-to-day operation of the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> To monitor for,
            detect, and prevent malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
            activity on our Services. This includes analyzing IP addresses and
            request patterns to mitigate DDoS attacks and other threats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Analytics and Service Improvement:</strong> To conduct
            research and analysis on user behavior and service performance. This
            allows us to understand which features are most valuable, improve the
            user experience, and allocate development resources effectively.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical Maintenance and Debugging:</strong> To identify and
            resolve technical issues, crashes, and errors that may impair the
            functionality of the Services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal and Regulatory Compliance:</strong> To enforce our Terms
            of Service and to comply with applicable laws, court orders, or other
            legal processes.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          We uphold a strict policy against selling or renting your Personal Data.
          We may disclose your information to third parties only in the limited
          circumstances detailed below.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Third-Party Processors (Service Providers):</strong> We engage
            reputable third-party companies and individuals to perform services
            on our behalf. These may include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Cloud Infrastructure Providers:</strong> For hosting our
                website and its backend services (e.g., Vercel, Render). These
                providers do not have access to application-level data except as
                required for infrastructure maintenance.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Generative AI Service Providers:</strong> For specific tools
                like code translation, your User Content is sent via a secure API
                call to a third-party AI model for processing. We use providers
                who have committed to not using API-submitted data for model
                training and to not retain the data longer than necessary for the
                transaction.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Analytics Partners:</strong> We may use third-party
                analytics services (e.g., a privacy-focused alternative to Google
                Analytics) to help us understand service usage. These services
                are configured to anonymize IP addresses and respect user privacy.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Legal Requirements and Protection of Rights:</strong> We may
            disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good
            faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
            obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of
            CodeManipulate, (iii) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in
            connection with the Service, or (iv) protect the personal safety of
            users of the Service or the public.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger,
            acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, your information may
            be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice before
            your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different
            privacy policy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Cookie Policy and User Choices</h2>
        <h3>6.1. What Are Cookies?</h3>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files placed on your device by websites that you
          visit. They are widely used to make websites work, or work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the
          site.
        </p>
        <h3>6.2. How We Use Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          We use cookies for the following purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</strong> These cookies are essential
            for you to browse the website and use its features. Without these,
            services like remembering your session cannot be provided.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Functionality Cookies:</strong> These are used to recognize you
            when you return to our website and to remember your preferences. For
            example, we use a cookie (`theme`) to store your preference for dark
            or light mode, so you do not have to set it on every visit.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Performance/Analytics Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect
            information about how you use our website, like which pages you

        <h2>7. Data Security Measures</h2>
        <p>
          We are committed to protecting your information. We have implemented
          appropriate and commercially reasonable technical, physical, and
          administrative security measures to protect against unauthorized
          access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of information. These
          measures include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Encryption:</strong> We use SSL/TLS encryption to protect data
            in transit between your browser and our servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access Controls:</strong> We enforce strict access controls
            within our organization, ensuring that only authorized personnel have
            access to user data on a need-to-know basis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infrastructure Security:</strong> We rely on secure cloud
            infrastructure providers who maintain high standards of physical and
            network security.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Despite our safeguards, no electronic transmission or storage is 100%
          secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information,
          and we encourage you to be cautious.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Data Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We retain Usage Data and other Personal Data for as long as necessary to
          fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer
          retention period is required or permitted by law. Server logs containing
          IP addresses are typically rotated and deleted within 90 days.
          Anonymized analytics data may be retained for longer periods for
          statistical purposes. As stated, User Content is not retained post-processing.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You have certain rights regarding your Personal Data, subject to local
          data protection laws. Depending on your location, these may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>The right to access, update, or delete</strong> the
            information we have on you.
          </li>
          <li><strong>The right of rectification.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The right to object</strong> to our processing.</li>
          <li><strong>The right of restriction.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The right to data portability.</strong></li>
          <li>
            <strong>The right to withdraw consent</strong> at any time where we
            relied on your consent to process your personal information.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To exercise these rights, please contact us. Note that given the minimal
          Personal Data we collect, the applicability of some rights may be
          limited. For instance, as we do not have user accounts, requests to
          "delete your information" would be limited to data linked to your
          browser's cookies or specific correspondence you have sent us.
        </p>

        <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and
          maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province,
          country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection
          laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction. Our primary hosting is
          in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, your
          information will be transferred to the US. We take all steps reasonably
          necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance
          with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
